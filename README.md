# Black and White Game Jam 9
 
- First game jam game made for the Black and White Game jam where your color palette is restricted to two colors.
- Made in just under a week, this game contains quite a few bugs but I learned a lot about Unity, C#, and managing time wisely to complete a project under a tight deadline. This game is by no means great but I plan to partake in future game jams and hackathons to learn and grow in my project management and software development skills.
